# pre_dividend

Before Running Program:
1. Make sure all dependencies are installed
2. Make sure Firefox is installed and and updated to the latest version 

Things to Note:
1. Have to implement a way to check if we have actually purchased the stock before adding it into database (may be an error during the order)
2. I have to to the same for selling stocks ^
3. Maybe add a trailing stop loss instead of set percentage stop loss?
4. Not quite sure how to implement this: 
- Database checking for selling should occur every day, buying algorithm should occur every day. (Just run program once a day?)
