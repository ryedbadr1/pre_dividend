# pre_dividend

Before Running Program:
1. Make sure all dependencies are installed
2. Make sure Firefox is installed and and updated to the latest version 

Things to Note:
1. I still have to implement a way to stay under the PDT rule (even though this should not be an issue the way the algo is designed)
2. Have to implement a way to check if we have actually purchased the stock before adding it into database (may be an error during the order)
3. I have to to the same for selling stocks ^
